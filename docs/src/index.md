# RELOG -- Supply Chain Design, Analysis and Optimization

**RELOG** is an open-source package designed to optimize supply chains for
forward, reverse and circular manufacturing. Using mixed-integer linear
optimization, RELOG helps users determine strategic decisions such as:

- Where and when to build manufacturing and recycling plants
- The size of these plants, when to expand them, and by how much
- The sources for each plant's input materials and the destinations for their
  processed outputs
- Whether to process input materials immediatelly or store them for later use

RELOG has been successully applied in research at various laboratories and
universities, focusing on areas like critical material recovery from spent NiMH
and Li-Ion batteries, biomass processing for hydrogen production, and the
recycling of electronics, plastics and solar PV materials, among others. See
references for more details.
