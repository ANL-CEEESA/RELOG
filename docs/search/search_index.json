RELOG accepts as input a JSON file with three sections: parameters , products and plants . Below, we describe each section in more detail. Parameters The parameters section describes details about the simulation itself. Key Description time horizon (years) Number of years in the simulation. building period (years) List of years in which we are allowed to open new plants. For example, if this parameter is set to [1,2,3] , we can only open plants during the first three years. By default, this equals [1] ; that is, plants can only be opened during the first year. Example { \"parameters\": { \"time horizon (years)\": 2, \"building period (years)\": [1] } } Products The products section describes all products and subproducts in the simulation. The field instance[\"Products\"] is a dictionary mapping the name of the product to a dictionary which describes its characteristics. Each product description contains the following keys: Key Description transportation cost ($/km/tonne) The cost to transport this product. Must be a timeseries. transportation energy (J/km/tonne) The energy required to transport this product. Must be a timeseries. Optional. transportation emissions (tonne/km/tonne) A dictionary mapping the name of each greenhouse gas, produced to transport one tonne of this product along one kilometer, to the amount of gas produced (in tonnes). Must be a timeseries. Optional. initial amounts A dictionary mapping the name of each location to its description (see below). If this product is not initially available, this key may be omitted. Must be a timeseries. Each product may have some amount available at the beginning of each time period. In this case, the key initial amounts maps to a dictionary with the following keys: Key Description latitude (deg) The latitude of the location. longitude (deg) The longitude of the location. amount (tonne) The amount of the product initially available at the location. Must be a timeseries. Example { \"products\": { \"P1\": { \"initial amounts\": { \"C1\": { \"latitude (deg)\": 7.0, \"longitude (deg)\": 7.0, \"amount (tonne)\": [934.56, 934.56] }, \"C2\": { \"latitude (deg)\": 7.0, \"longitude (deg)\": 19.0, \"amount (tonne)\": [198.95, 198.95] }, \"C3\": { \"latitude (deg)\": 84.0, \"longitude (deg)\": 76.0, \"amount (tonne)\": [212.97, 212.97] } }, \"transportation cost ($/km/tonne)\": [0.015, 0.015], \"transportation energy (J/km/tonne)\": [0.12, 0.11], \"transportation emissions (tonne/km/tonne)\": { \"CO2\": [0.052, 0.050], \"CH4\": [0.003, 0.002] } }, \"P2\": { \"transportation cost ($/km/tonne)\": [0.022, 0.020] }, \"P3\": { \"transportation cost ($/km/tonne)\": [0.0125, 0.0125] }, \"P4\": { \"transportation cost ($/km/tonne)\": [0.0175, 0.0175] } } } Processing Plants The plants section describes the available types of reverse manufacturing plants, their potential locations and associated costs, as well as their inputs and outputs. The field instance[\"Plants\"] is a dictionary mapping the name of the plant to a dictionary with the following keys: Key Description input The name of the product that this plant takes as input. Only one input is accepted per plant. outputs (tonne/tonne) A dictionary specifying how many tonnes of each product is produced for each tonnes of input. For example, if the plant outputs 0.5 tonnes of P2 and 0.25 tonnes of P3 for each tonnes of P1 provided, then this entry should be {\"P2\": 0.5, \"P3\": 0.25} . If the plant does not output anything, this key may be omitted. energy (GJ/tonne) The energy required to process 1 tonne of the input. Must be a timeseries. Optional. emissions (tonne/tonne) A dictionary mapping the name of each greenhouse gas, produced to process each tonne of input, to the amount of gas produced (in tonne). Must be a timeseries. Optional. locations A dictionary mapping the name of the location to a dictionary which describes the site characteristics (see below). Each type of plant is associated with a set of potential locations where it can be built. Each location is represented by a dictionary with the following keys: Key Description latitude (deg) The latitude of the location, in degrees. longitude (deg) The longitude of the location, in degrees. disposal A dictionary describing what products can be disposed locally at the plant. capacities (tonne) A dictionary describing what plant sizes are allowed, and their characteristics. The keys in the disposal dictionary should be the names of the products. The values are dictionaries with the following keys: Key Description cost ($/tonne) The cost to dispose of the product. Must be a timeseries. limit (tonne) The maximum amount that can be disposed of. If an unlimited amount can be disposed, this key may be omitted. Must be a timeseries. The keys in the capacities (tonne) dictionary should be the amounts (in tonnes). The values are dictionaries with the following keys: Key Description opening cost ($) The cost to open a plant of this size. fixed operating cost ($) The cost to keep the plant open, even if the plant doesn't process anything. Must be a timeseries. variable operating cost ($/tonne) The cost that the plant incurs to process each tonne of input. Must be a timeseries. Example { \"plants\": { \"F1\": { \"input\": \"P1\", \"outputs (tonne/tonne)\": { \"P2\": 0.2, \"P3\": 0.5 }, \"energy (GJ/tonne)\": [0.12, 0.11], \"emissions (tonne/tonne)\": { \"CO2\": [0.052, 0.050], \"CH4\": [0.003, 0.002] }, \"locations\": { \"L1\": { \"latitude (deg)\": 0.0, \"longitude (deg)\": 0.0, \"disposal\": { \"P2\": { \"cost ($/tonne)\": [-10.0, -12.0], \"limit (tonne)\": [1.0, 1.0] } }, \"capacities (tonne)\": { \"100\": { \"opening cost ($)\": [500, 530], \"fixed operating cost ($)\": [300.0, 310.0], \"variable operating cost ($/tonne)\": [5.0, 5.2] }, \"500\": { \"opening cost ($)\": [750, 760], \"fixed operating cost ($)\": [400.0, 450.0], \"variable operating cost ($/tonne)\": [5.0, 5.2] } } } } } } } Current limitations Each plant can only be opened exactly once. After open, the plant remains open until the end of the simulation. Plants can be expanded at any time, even long after they are open. All material available at the beginning of a time period must be entirely processed by the end of that time period. It is not possible to store unprocessed materials from one time period to the next. Up to two plant sizes are currently supported. Variable operating costs must be the same for all plant sizes.","title":"Data Format"},{"location":"format/#input-data-format","text":"The first step when using RELOG is to describe the reverse logistics pipeline and the relevant data.

This constraint also prevents a plant from being built multiple times. \\begin{align} & x_{pt} = x_{p,t-1} + u_{pt} & \\forall p \\in P, t \\in T \\setminus \\{1\\} \\\\ & x_{p,1} = u_{p,1} & \\forall p \\in P \\end{align} Variable bounds: \\begin{align} & q_{mpt} \\geq 0 & \\forall m \\in M, p \\in P, t \\in T \\\\ & u_{pt} \\in \\{0,1\\} & \\forall p \\in P, t \\in T \\\\ & w_{pt} \\geq 0 & \\forall p \\in P, t \\in T \\\\ & x_{pt} \\in \\{0,1\\} & \\forall p \\in P, t \\in T \\\\ & y_{lpt} \\geq 0 & \\forall l \\in L, p \\in P, t \\in T \\\\ & m^\\text{disp}_{pmt} \\geq z_{mpt} \\geq 0 & \\forall m \\in M, p \\in P, t \\in T \\\\ \\end{align}","title":"Constraints"},{"location":"usage/","text":"Usage 1. Installation To use RELOG, the first step is to install the Julia programming language on your machine.

Modeling the problem The two main model components in RELOG are products and plants . A product is any material that needs to be recycled, any intermediary product produced during the recycling process, or any product recovered at the end of the process. For example, in a NiMH battery recycling study case, products could include (i) the original batteries to be recycled; (ii) the cathode and anode parts of the battery; (iii) rare-earth elements and (iv) scrap metals. The model assumes that some products are initially available at user-specified locations (described by their latitude, longitude and the amount available), while other products only become available during the recycling process. Transporting products from one location to another incurs a transportation cost ( $/km/tonne ), spends some amount of energy ( J/km/tonne ) and may generate multiple types of emissions ( tonne/tonne ). All these parameters are user-specified and may be product- and time-specific. A plant is a facility that converts one type of product to another. RELOG assumes that each plant receives a single type of product as input and converts this input into multiple types of products. Multiple types of plants, with different inputs, outputs and performance characteristics, may be specified. In the NiMH battery recycling study case, for example, one type of plant could be a disassembly plant , which converts batteries into cathode and anode . Another type of plant could be anode recycling plant , which converts anode into rare-earth elements and scrap metals . To process each tonne of input material, plants incur a variable operating cost ( $/tonne ), spend some amount of energy ( GJ/tonne ), and produce multiple types of emissions ( tonne/tonne ). Plants also incur a fixed operating cost ( $ ) regardless of the amount of material they process. All these parameters are user-specified and may be region- and time-specific. Plants can be built at user-specified potential locations. Opening a plant incurs a one-time opening cost ( $ ) which may be region- and time-specific. Plants also have a limited capacity (in tonne ), which indicates the maximum amount of input material they are able to process per year. When specifying potential locations for each type of plant, it is also possible to specify the minimum and maximum capacity of the plants that can be built at that particular location. Different plants sizes may have different opening costs and fixed operating costs. After a plant is built, it can be further expanded in the following years, up to its maximum capacity. All products that are initially available must be sent to a plant for processing. All products that are generated by a plant can either be sent to another plant for further processing, or disposed of locally for either a profit or a loss ( $/tonne ). To model environmental regulations, it is also possible to specify the maximum amount of each product that can be disposed of at each location. All user parameters specified above must be provided to RELOG as a JSON file, which is fully described in the data format page . 3. Running the optimization After creating a JSON file describing the reverse manufacturing process and the input data, the following example illustrates how to use the package to find the optimal set of decisions: using RELOG RELOG.solve(\"/home/user/instance.json\", output=\"/home/user/solution.json\") The optimal logistics plan will be stored in the output file specified. See data format page for a description of this output file. 4. Advanced options 4.1 Changing the solver By default, RELOG internally uses Cbc , an open-source and freely-available Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solver developed by the COIN-OR Project . For larger-scale test cases, a commercial solver such as Gurobi, CPLEX or XPRESS is recommended. The following snippet shows how to switch from Cbc to Gurobi, for example: using RELOG, Gurobi, JuMP gurobi = optimizer_with_attributes(Gurobi.Optimizer, \"TimeLimit\" => 3600, \"MIPGap\" => 0.001) RELOG.solve(\"instance.json\", output=\"solution.json\", optimizer=gurobi)","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#1-installation","text":"To use RELOG, the first step is to install the Julia programming language on your machine.
