In addition to these, RELOG can also produce simplified reports in tabular data format. Input Data Format (JSON) RELOG accepts as input a JSON file with three sections: parameters , products and plants . Below, we describe each section in more detail. Parameters The parameters section describes details about the simulation itself. Key Description time horizon (years) Number of years in the simulation. building period (years) List of years in which we are allowed to open new plants. For example, if this parameter is set to [1,2,3] , we can only open plants during the first three years. By default, this equals [1] ; that is, plants can only be opened during the first year. Example { \"parameters\": { \"time horizon (years)\": 2, \"building period (years)\": [1] } } Products The products section describes all products and subproducts in the simulation. The field instance[\"Products\"] is a dictionary mapping the name of the product to a dictionary which describes its characteristics. Each product description contains the following keys: Key Description transportation cost ($/km/tonne) The cost to transport this product. Must be a time series. transportation energy (J/km/tonne) The energy required to transport this product. Must be a time series. Optional. transportation emissions (tonne/km/tonne) A dictionary mapping the name of each greenhouse gas, produced to transport one tonne of this product along one kilometer, to the amount of gas produced (in tonnes). Must be a time series. Optional. initial amounts A dictionary mapping the name of each location to its description (see below). If this product is not initially available, this key may be omitted. Must be a time series. Each product may have some amount available at the beginning of each time period. In this case, the key initial amounts maps to a dictionary with the following keys: Key Description latitude (deg) The latitude of the location. longitude (deg) The longitude of the location. amount (tonne) The amount of the product initially available at the location. Must be a time series. Example { \"products\": { \"P1\": { \"initial amounts\": { \"C1\": { \"latitude (deg)\": 7.0, \"longitude (deg)\": 7.0, \"amount (tonne)\": [934.56, 934.56] }, \"C2\": { \"latitude (deg)\": 7.0, \"longitude (deg)\": 19.0, \"amount (tonne)\": [198.95, 198.95] }, \"C3\": { \"latitude (deg)\": 84.0, \"longitude (deg)\": 76.0, \"amount (tonne)\": [212.97, 212.97] } }, \"transportation cost ($/km/tonne)\": [0.015, 0.015], \"transportation energy (J/km/tonne)\": [0.12, 0.11], \"transportation emissions (tonne/km/tonne)\": { \"CO2\": [0.052, 0.050], \"CH4\": [0.003, 0.002] } }, \"P2\": { \"transportation cost ($/km/tonne)\": [0.022, 0.020] }, \"P3\": { \"transportation cost ($/km/tonne)\": [0.0125, 0.0125] }, \"P4\": { \"transportation cost ($/km/tonne)\": [0.0175, 0.0175] } } } Processing plants The plants section describes the available types of reverse manufacturing plants, their potential locations and associated costs, as well as their inputs and outputs. The field instance[\"Plants\"] is a dictionary mapping the name of the plant to a dictionary with the following keys: Key Description input The name of the product that this plant takes as input. Only one input is accepted per plant. outputs (tonne/tonne) A dictionary specifying how many tonnes of each product is produced for each tonnes of input. For example, if the plant outputs 0.5 tonnes of P2 and 0.25 tonnes of P3 for each tonnes of P1 provided, then this entry should be {\"P2\": 0.5, \"P3\": 0.25} . If the plant does not output anything, this key may be omitted. energy (GJ/tonne) The energy required to process 1 tonne of the input. Must be a time series. Optional. emissions (tonne/tonne) A dictionary mapping the name of each greenhouse gas, produced to process each tonne of input, to the amount of gas produced (in tonne). Must be a time series. Optional. locations A dictionary mapping the name of the location to a dictionary which describes the site characteristics (see below). Each type of plant is associated with a set of potential locations where it can be built. Each location is represented by a dictionary with the following keys: Key Description latitude (deg) The latitude of the location, in degrees. longitude (deg) The longitude of the location, in degrees. disposal A dictionary describing what products can be disposed locally at the plant. storage A dictionary describing the plant's storage. capacities (tonne) A dictionary describing what plant sizes are allowed, and their characteristics. The storage dictionary should contain the following keys: Key Description cost ($/tonne) The cost to store a tonne of input product for one time period. Must be a time series. limit (tonne) The maximum amount of input product this plant can have in storage at any given time. The keys in the disposal dictionary should be the names of the products. The values are dictionaries with the following keys: Key Description cost ($/tonne) The cost to dispose of the product. Must be a time series. limit (tonne) The maximum amount that can be disposed of. If an unlimited amount can be disposed, this key may be omitted. Must be a time series. The keys in the capacities (tonne) dictionary should be the amounts (in tonnes). The values are dictionaries with the following keys: Key Description opening cost ($) The cost to open a plant of this size. fixed operating cost ($) The cost to keep the plant open, even if the plant doesn't process anything. Must be a time series. variable operating cost ($/tonne) The cost that the plant incurs to process each tonne of input. Must be a time series. Example { \"plants\": { \"F1\": { \"input\": \"P1\", \"outputs (tonne/tonne)\": { \"P2\": 0.2, \"P3\": 0.5 }, \"energy (GJ/tonne)\": [0.12, 0.11], \"emissions (tonne/tonne)\": { \"CO2\": [0.052, 0.050], \"CH4\": [0.003, 0.002] }, \"locations\": { \"L1\": { \"latitude (deg)\": 0.0, \"longitude (deg)\": 0.0, \"disposal\": { \"P2\": { \"cost ($/tonne)\": [-10.0, -12.0], \"limit (tonne)\": [1.0, 1.0] } }, \"storage\": { \"cost ($/tonne)\": [5.0, 5.3], \"limit (tonne)\": 100.0, }, \"capacities (tonne)\": { \"100\": { \"opening cost ($)\": [500, 530], \"fixed operating cost ($)\": [300.0, 310.0], \"variable operating cost ($/tonne)\": [5.0, 5.2], }, \"500\": { \"opening cost ($)\": [750, 760], \"fixed operating cost ($)\": [400.0, 450.0], \"variable operating cost ($/tonne)\": [5.0, 5.2] } } } } } } } Geographic database Instead of specifying locations using latitudes and longitudes, it is also possible to specify them using unique identifiers, such as the name of a US state, or the county FIPS code. This works anywhere latitude (deg) and longitude (deg) are expected. For example, instead of: { \"initial amounts\": { \"C1\": { \"latitude (deg)\": 37.27182, \"longitude (deg)\": -119.2704, \"amount (tonne)\": [934.56, 934.56] }, } } is is possible to write: { \"initial amounts\": { \"C1\": { \"location\": \"us-state:CA\", \"amount (tonne)\": [934.56, 934.56] }, } } Location names follow the format db:id , where db is the name of the database and id is the identifier for a specific location. RELOG currently includes the following databases: Database Description Examples us-state List of states of the United States. us-state:IL (State of Illinois) 2018-us-county List of United States counties, as of 2018. IDs are 5-digit FIPS codes. 2018-us-county:17043 (DuPage county in Illinois) Current limitations Each plant can only be opened exactly once. After open, the plant remains open until the end of the simulation. Plants can be expanded at any time, even long after they are open. All material available at the beginning of a time period must be entirely processed by the end of that time period. It is not possible to store unprocessed materials from one time period to the next. Up to two plant sizes are currently supported. Variable operating costs must be the same for all plant sizes.

Mathematical Description Sets $L$ - Set of locations holding the original material to be recycled $M$ - Set of materials recovered during the reverse manufacturing process $P$ - Set of potential plants to open $T = { 1, \\ldots, t^{max} } $ - Set of time periods Constants Plants: $c^\\text{disp}_{pmt}$ - Cost of disposing one tonne of material $m$ at plant $p$ during time $t$ ( $/tonne/km ) $c^\\text{exp}_{pt}$ - Cost of adding one tonne of capacity to plant $p$ at time $t$ ( $/tonne ) $c^\\text{open}_{pt}$ - Cost of opening plant $p$ at time $t$, at minimum capacity ( $ ) $c^\\text{f-base}_{pt}$ - Fixed cost of keeping plant $p$ open during time period $t$ ( $ ) $c^\\text{f-exp}_{pt}$ - Increase in fixed cost for each additional tonne of capacity ( $/tonne ) $c^\\text{var}_{pt}$ - Variable cost of processing one tonne of input at plant $p$ at time $t$ ( $/tonne ) $c^\\text{store}_{pt}$ - Cost of storing one tonne of original material at plant $p$ at time $t$ ( $/tonne ) $m^\\text{min}_p$ - Minimum capacity of plant $p$ ( tonne ) $m^\\text{max}_p$ - Maximum capacity of plant $p$ ( tonne ) $m^\\text{disp}_{pmt}$ - Maximum amount of material $m$ that plant $p$ can dispose of during time $t$ ( tonne ) $m^\\text{store}_p$ - Maximum amount of original material that plant $p$ can store for later processing. Products: $\\alpha_{pm}$ - Amount of material $m$ recovered by plant $t$ for each tonne of original material ( tonne/tonne ) $m^\\text{initial}_{lt}$ - Amount of original material to be recycled at location $l$ during time $t$ ( tonne ) Transportation: $c^\\text{tr}_{t}$ - Transportation cost during time $t$ ( $/tonne/km ) $d_{lp}$ - Distance between plant $p$ and location $l$ ( km ) Decision variables $q_{mpt}$ - Amount of material $m$ recovered by plant $p$ during time $t$ ( tonne ) $u_{pt}$ - Binary variable that equals 1 if plant $p$ starts operating at time $t$ ( bool ) $w_{pt}$ - Extra capacity (amount above the minimum) added to plant $p$ during time $t$ ( tonne ) $x_{pt}$ - Binary variable that equals 1 if plant $p$ is operational at time $t$ ( bool ) $y_{lpt}$ - Amount of product sent from location $l$ to plant $p$ during time $t$ ( tonne ) $z^{\\text{disp}}_{mpt}$ - Amount of material $m$ disposed of by plant $p$ during time $t$ ( tonne ) $z^{\\text{store}}_{pt}$ - Amount of original material in storage at plant $p$ by the end of time period $t$ ( tonne ) $z^{\\text{proc}}_{mpt}$ - Amount of original material processed by plant $p$ during time period $t$ ( tonne ) Objective function RELOG minimizes the overall capital, production and transportation costs: \\begin{align*} \\text{minimize} \\;\\; & \\sum_{t \\in T} \\sum_{p \\in P} \\left[ c^\\text{open}_{pt} u_{pt} + c^\\text{f-base}_{pt} x_{pt} + \\sum_{i=1}^t c^\\text{f-exp}_{pt} w_{pi} + c^{\\text{exp}}_{pt} w_{pt} \\right] + \\\\ & \\sum_{t \\in T} \\sum_{p \\in P} \\left[ c^{\\text{store}}_{pt} z^{\\text{store}}_{pt} + c^{\\text{proc}}_{pt} z^{\\text{proc}}_{pt} \\right] + \\\\ & \\sum_{t \\in T} \\sum_{l \\in L} \\sum_{p \\in P} c^{\\text{tr}}_t d_{lp} y_{lpt} \\\\ & \\sum_{t \\in T} \\sum_{p \\in P} \\sum_{m \\in M} c^{\\text{disp}}_{pmt} z_{pmt} \\end{align*} In the first line, we have (i) opening costs, if plant starts operating at time $t$, (ii) fixed operating costs, if plant is operational, (iii) additional fixed operating costs coming from expansion performed in all previous time periods up to the current one, and finally (iv) the expansion costs during the current time period. In the second line, we have storage and variable processing costs. In the third line, we have transportation costs. In the fourth line, we have the disposal costs. Constraints All original materials must be sent to a plant: \\begin{align} & \\sum_{p \\in P} y_{lpt} = m^\\text{initial}_{lt} & \\forall l \\in L, t \\in T \\end{align} Amount received equals amount processed plus stored. Furthermore, all original material should be processed by the end of the simulation. \\begin{align} & \\sum_{l \\in L} y_{lpt} + z^{\\text{store}}_{p,t-1} = z^{\\text{proc}}_{pt} + z^{\\text{store}}_{p,t} & \\forall p \\in P, t \\in T \\\\ & z^{\\text{store}}_{p,0} = 0 & \\forall p \\in P \\\\ & z^{\\text{store}}_{p,t^{\\max}} = 0 & \\forall p \\in P \\end{align} Plants have a limited processing capacity. Furthermore, if a plant is closed, it has zero processing capacity: \\begin{align} & z^{\\text{proc}}_{pt} \\leq m^\\text{min}_p x_p + \\sum_{i=1}^t w_p & \\forall p \\in P, t \\in T \\end{align} Plants have limited storage capacity. Furthermore, if a plant is closed, is has zero storage capacity: \\begin{align} & z^{\\text{store}}_{pt} \\leq m^\\text{store}_p x_p & \\forall p \\in P, t \\in T \\end{align} Plants can only be expanded up to their maximum capacity. Furthermore, if a plant is closed, it cannot be expanded: \\begin{align} & \\sum_{i=1}^t w_p \\leq m^\\text{max}_p x_p & \\forall p \\in P, t \\in T \\end{align} Amount of recovered material is proportional to amount processed: \\begin{align} & q_{mpt} = \\alpha_{pm} z^{\\text{proc}}_{pt} & \\forall m \\in M, p \\in P, t \\in T \\end{align} Because we only consider a single type of plant, all recovered material must be immediately disposed of. In RELOG's full model, recovered materials may be sent to another plant for further processing. \\begin{align} & q_{mpt} = z_{mpt} & \\forall m \\in M, p \\in P, t \\in T \\end{align} A plant is operational at time $t$ if it was operational at time $t-1$ or it was built at time $t$.

After Julia is installed, launch the Julia console, type ] to switch to package manger mode, then run: (@v1.5) pkg> add https://github.com/ANL-CEEESA/RELOG.git After the package and all its dependencies have been installed, please run the RELOG test suite, as shown below, to make sure that the package has been correctly installed: (@v1.5) pkg> test RELOG To update the package to a newer version, type ] to enter the package manager mode, then run: (@v1.5) pkg> update RELOG 2. Modeling the problem The two main model components in RELOG are products and plants . A product is any material that needs to be recycled, any intermediary product produced during the recycling process, or any product recovered at the end of the process. For example, in a NiMH battery recycling study case, products could include (i) the original batteries to be recycled; (ii) the cathode and anode parts of the battery; (iii) rare-earth elements and (iv) scrap metals. The model assumes that some products are initially available at user-specified locations (described by their latitude, longitude and the amount available), while other products only become available during the recycling process. Products that are initially available must be sent to a plant for processing during the same time period they became available. Transporting products from one location to another incurs a transportation cost ( $/km/tonne ), spends some amount of energy ( J/km/tonne ) and may generate multiple types of emissions ( tonne/tonne ). All these parameters are user-specified and may be product- and time-specific. A plant is a facility that converts one type of product to another. RELOG assumes that each plant receives a single type of product as input and converts this input into multiple types of products. Multiple types of plants, with different inputs, outputs and performance characteristics, may be specified. In the NiMH battery recycling study case, for example, one type of plant could be a disassembly plant , which converts batteries into cathode and anode . Another type of plant could be anode recycling plant , which converts anode into rare-earth elements and scrap metals . To process each tonne of input material, plants incur a variable operating cost ( $/tonne ), spend some amount of energy ( GJ/tonne ), and produce multiple types of emissions ( tonne/tonne ). Plants also incur a fixed operating cost ( $ ) regardless of the amount of material they process. All these parameters are user-specified and may be region- and time-specific. Plants can be built at user-specified potential locations. Opening a plant incurs a one-time opening cost ( $ ) which may be region- and time-specific. Plants also have a limited capacity (in tonne ), which indicates the maximum amount of input material they are able to process per year. When specifying potential locations for each type of plant, it is also possible to specify the minimum and maximum capacity of the plants that can be built at that particular location. Different plants sizes may have different opening costs and fixed operating costs. After a plant is built, it can be further expanded in the following years, up to its maximum capacity. Products received by a plant can be either processed immediately or stored for later processing. Plants have a maximum storage capacity ( tonne ). Storage costs ( $/tonne ) can also be specified. All products generated by a plant can either be sent to another plant for further processing, or disposed of locally for either a profit or a loss ( $/tonne ). To model environmental regulations, it is also possible to specify the maximum amount of each product that can be disposed of at each location. All user parameters specified above must be provided to RELOG as a JSON file, which is fully described in the data format page . 3. Running the optimization After creating a JSON file describing the reverse manufacturing process and the input data, the following example illustrates how to use the package to find the optimal set of decisions: # Import package using RELOG # Solve optimization problem solution = RELOG.solve(\"/home/user/instance.json\") # Write full solution in JSON format RELOG.write(solution, \"solution.json\") # Write simplified reports in CSV format RELOG.write_plants_report(solution, \"plants.csv\") RELOG.write_transportation_report(solution, \"transportation.csv\") For a complete description of the file formats above, and for a complete list of available reports, see the data format page . 4. What-If Analysis Fundamentally, RELOG decides when and where to build plants based on a deterministic optimization problem that minimizes costs for a particular input file provided by the user. In practical situations, it may not be possible to perfectly estimate some (or most) entries in this input file in advance, such as costs, demands and emissions. In this situation, it may be interesting to evaluate how well does the facility location plan produced by RELOG work if costs, demands and emissions turn out to be different. To simplify this what-if analysis, RELOG provides the resolve method, which updates a previous solution based on a new scenario, but keeps some of the previous decisions fixed. More precisely, given an optimal solution produced by RELOG and a new input file describing the new scenario, the resolve method reoptimizes the supply chain and produces a new solution which still builds the same set of plants as before, in exactly the same locations and with the same capacities, but that may now utilize the plants differently, based on the new data. For example, in the new solution, plants that were previously used at full capacity may now be utilized at half-capacity instead. As another example, regions that were previously served by a certain plant may now be served by a different one. The following snippet shows how to use the method: # Import package using RELOG # Optimize for the average scenario solution_avg, model_avg = RELOG.solve(\"input_avg.json\", return_model=true) # Write reports for the average scenario RELOG.write_plants_report(solution_avg, \"plants_avg.csv\") RELOG.write_transportation_report(solution_avg, \"transportation_avg.csv\") # Re-optimize for the high-demand scenario, keeping plants fixed solution_high = RELOG.resolve(model_avg, \"input_high.json\") # Write reports for the high-demand scenario RELOG.write_plants_report(solution_high, \"plants_high.csv\") RELOG.write_transportation_report(solution_high, \"transportation_high.csv\") To use the resolve method, the new input file should be very similar to the original one. Only the following entries are allowed to change: Products: Transportation costs, energy, emissions and initial amounts (latitude, longitude and amount). Plants: Energy and emissions. Plant's location: Latitude and longitude. Plant's storage: Cost. Plant's capacity: Opening cost, fixed operating cost and variable operating cost. 5. Advanced options 5.1 Changing the solver By default, RELOG internally uses Cbc , an open-source and freely-available Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solver developed by the COIN-OR Project . For larger-scale test cases, a commercial solver such as Gurobi, CPLEX or XPRESS is recommended. The following snippet shows how to switch from Cbc to Gurobi, for example: using RELOG, Gurobi, JuMP gurobi = optimizer_with_attributes(Gurobi.Optimizer, \"TimeLimit\" => 3600, \"MIPGap\" => 0.001) RELOG.solve(\"instance.json\", output=\"solution.json\", optimizer=gurobi) 5.2 Multi-period heuristics For large-scale instances, it may be too time-consuming to find an exact optimal solution to the multi-period version of the problem. For these situations, RELOG includes a heuristic solution method, which proceeds as follows: First, RELOG creates a single-period version of the problem, in which most values are replaced by their averages. This single-period problem is typically much easier to solve. After solving the simplified problem, RELOG resolves the multi-period version of the problem, but considering only candidate plant locations that were selected by the optimal solution to the single-period version of the problem. All remaining candidate plant locations are removed. To solve an instance using this heuristic, use the option heuristic=true , as shown below. using RELOG solution = RELOG.solve(\"/home/user/instance.json\", heuristic=true)","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage","text":"","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#1-installation","text":"To use RELOG, the first step is to install the Julia programming language on your machine.

Installation"},{"location":"usage/#2-modeling-the-problem","text":"The two main model components in RELOG are products and plants . A product is any material that needs to be recycled, any intermediary product produced during the recycling process, or any product recovered at the end of the process. For example, in a NiMH battery recycling study case, products could include (i) the original batteries to be recycled; (ii) the cathode and anode parts of the battery; (iii) rare-earth elements and (iv) scrap metals. The model assumes that some products are initially available at user-specified locations (described by their latitude, longitude and the amount available), while other products only become available during the recycling process. Products that are initially available must be sent to a plant for processing during the same time period they became available. Transporting products from one location to another incurs a transportation cost ( $/km/tonne ), spends some amount of energy ( J/km/tonne ) and may generate multiple types of emissions ( tonne/tonne ). All these parameters are user-specified and may be product- and time-specific. A plant is a facility that converts one type of product to another. RELOG assumes that each plant receives a single type of product as input and converts this input into multiple types of products. Multiple types of plants, with different inputs, outputs and performance characteristics, may be specified. In the NiMH battery recycling study case, for example, one type of plant could be a disassembly plant , which converts batteries into cathode and anode . Another type of plant could be anode recycling plant , which converts anode into rare-earth elements and scrap metals . To process each tonne of input material, plants incur a variable operating cost ( $/tonne ), spend some amount of energy ( GJ/tonne ), and produce multiple types of emissions ( tonne/tonne ). Plants also incur a fixed operating cost ( $ ) regardless of the amount of material they process. All these parameters are user-specified and may be region- and time-specific. Plants can be built at user-specified potential locations. Opening a plant incurs a one-time opening cost ( $ ) which may be region- and time-specific. Plants also have a limited capacity (in tonne ), which indicates the maximum amount of input material they are able to process per year. When specifying potential locations for each type of plant, it is also possible to specify the minimum and maximum capacity of the plants that can be built at that particular location. Different plants sizes may have different opening costs and fixed operating costs. After a plant is built, it can be further expanded in the following years, up to its maximum capacity. Products received by a plant can be either processed immediately or stored for later processing. Plants have a maximum storage capacity ( tonne ). Storage costs ( $/tonne ) can also be specified. All products generated by a plant can either be sent to another plant for further processing, or disposed of locally for either a profit or a loss ( $/tonne ). To model environmental regulations, it is also possible to specify the maximum amount of each product that can be disposed of at each location. All user parameters specified above must be provided to RELOG as a JSON file, which is fully described in the data format page .","title":"2.
