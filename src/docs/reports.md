# Simplified Solution Reports

In addition to the full output format described in [data formats](format.md), RELOG can also generate a number of simplified reports in tabular data format (CSV), which can be more easily processed by spreadsheet software (such as Microsoft Excel), by data analysis libraries (such as Pandas) or by relational databases (such as SQLite).

In this page, we also illustrate what types of charts and visualizations can be produced from these tabular data files. The sample charts have been produced using Python, matplotlib, seaborn and geopandas.

## Plants report

Report showing plant costs, capacities, energy expenditure and utilization factors. Generated by `RELOG.write_plants_report(solution, filename)`.

import seaborn as sns; sns.set()

data = pd.read_csv("plants_report.csv")
sns.barplot(x="year",
            y="total cost ($)",
            hue="plant type",
            data=data.groupby(["plant type", "year"])
                     .sum()
                     .reset_index());
```
